# Used cars shop

The application functions as a compact online product store, complete with `payment` integration for purchases, `file storage` capabilities, and `email communication` features. This application, built on the traditional `MVC` architecture, has provided valuable insights into its strengths and weaknesses. It has also contributed to a deeper understanding of `Express.js`.

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind this project was to delve into older development methodologies, seeking to understand why they fell out of favor and identifying contexts where they might still be applicable in modern development practices. Through this exploration, valuable insights were gained into the evolution of software development methodologies and their relevance in contemporary contexts.

## What I was learn

I have learned MVC architecture and improved understanding of Express JS. Using Mongo added to my understanding of NoSQL.
